This code illustrates the steps to do a dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis using R. 
In order to plot the results we choose 2-Dimensions.

We then use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict the classes.
Next we plot the results beautifully using contour and prediction area plots
